# SapRPA-OB08
Update daily exchange rates on SAP-OB08.  The data is retrieved from www.bna.com.ar using web scraping.

The script is just an example where only the ARS-USD, ARS-EUR and USD-EUR exchange rates are updated, depending on defined business rules. However, it can be extrapolated and adapted to other business rules. 

When the script ends, an e-mail is sent to the process responsable so that they are aware of it.
